# CyberKit - Cybersecurity Offensive & Defensive Toolkit

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

A comprehensive, modular toolkit for cybersecurity professionals that automates both offensive and defensive security operations. CyberKit provides command-line utilities that streamline engagements from initial setup through reporting.

## Overview

CyberKit is divided into two main components:

- **OffensiveKit**: Tools for red team operations, penetration testing, and offensive security
- **DefensiveKit**: Tools for blue team operations, security monitoring, and defensive measures

## Features

### Offensive Capabilities
- Automated engagement setup and directory structure creation
- Comprehensive reconnaissance workflows
- Vulnerability scanning and assessment
- Web application testing integration
- Reporting and documentation generation
- API-enhanced intelligence gathering
- Attacking WiFi and Enterprise WiFi

### Defensive Capabilities
- Security monitoring and baseline configuration
- Operational security (OPSEC) hardening
- Network traffic anonymization
- Security policy enforcement
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- WiFi intrusion detection and active defense
- Malicious URL detection and analysis

### Core Features
- Secure API key management
- Standardized project structures
- Integration with industry standard tools
- Detailed markdown reporting
- OPSEC considerations at multiple levels
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux & macOS)
- **Docker containerization** for consistent deployment
- **Persistent data storage** for engagement continuity

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cyberkit.git

# Move to the cyberkit directory
cd cyberkit

# Install required dependencies
./install.sh

# Make scripts executable (if they aren't already)
chmod +x offensive/*.sh defensive/*.sh common/*.sh
```

## Dependencies

CyberKit integrates with and requires the following tools:

## Usage

### Offensive Tools

#### Initial Engagement Setup
```bash
./offensive/redteam-init.sh

# With API-enhanced reconnaissance
./offensive/redteam-init.sh --api-recon

# Or use test mode
./offensive/redteam-init.sh --test
```

#### Web Application Assessment
```bash
# Basic scan
./offensive/webapp-scan.sh -t target.com -o output_dir

# With API-enhanced reconnaissance
./offensive/webapp-scan.sh -t target.com --shodan --virustotal --securitytrails
```

#### Network Penetration Testing
```bash
# Basic scan
./offensive/network-scan.sh -t 192.168.1.0/24 -o output_dir

# With vulnerability scanning
./offensive/network-scan.sh -t 192.168.1.0/24 --vuln-scan

# With API-enhanced intelligence
./offensive/network-scan.sh -t 192.168.1.0/24 --vuln-scan --cve-lookup --threatintel
```

#### WiFi Penetration Testing
```bash
# Basic WiFi reconnaissance
./offensive/wifi-toolkit.sh scan -i wlan0

# Capture handshakes
./offensive/wifi-toolkit.sh capture -i wlan0 -b target_bssid

# Setup evil twin attack
./offensive/wifi-toolkit.sh eviltwin -i wlan0 -s "Target SSID"
```

### Defensive Tools

#### Operational Security Configuration
```bash
# Basic configuration
./defensive/opsec-config.sh -i eth0

# High security level
./defensive/opsec-config.sh -i eth0 -l high
```

#### WiFi Defence Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor WiFi for unauthorized access
./defensive/wifi-defence.sh monitor -i wlan0 -n "MyNetwork"

# Create baseline of trusted devices
./defensive/wifi-defence.sh baseline -i wlan0 -t 3600

# Active defense against intruders
./defensive/wifi-defence.sh defend -i wlan0 -b 00:11:22:33:44:55

# Enterprise WiFi monitoring
./defensive/wifi-defence.sh monitor -i wlan0 -m enterprise --threatintel
```

#### URL Security Analysis
```bash
# Basic URL scan
./defensive/url-scanner.sh https://example.com

# Comprehensive scan with all checks
./defensive/url-scanner.sh --all-checks --detailed https://example.com

# Passive mode analysis without connecting to target
./defensive/url-scanner.sh --passive --vt --phishtank https://example.com

# Batch URL processing
./defensive/url-scanner.sh --batch urls.txt --format json
```

### Shared Utilities

#### API Key Management
```bash
# Initialize API key store
./common/api-keys.sh init

# Add an API key
./common/api-keys.sh set shodan YOUR_API_KEY

# List configured services
./common/api-keys.sh list
```

#### Project Setup
```bash
# Create a new engagement directory structure
./common/engagement-setup.sh -c client-name -e engagement-name -t offensive
```
